# Agent-coalition-min-conflict
Project Overview The Iterated Symmetric Distributed Min-Conflict Heuristic (ISD-MCH) is a decentralized coordination algorithm designed for resource-constrained IoT devices and V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) systems. It solves the Maximum Clique Completion Problem (MCCP) to form conflict-free agent coalitions in real-time.
